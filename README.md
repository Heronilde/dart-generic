# Dart Generic

A generic Dart module designed to provide reusable components for handling CRUD operations using the Bloc pattern in a flexible and efficient way. This module can be easily integrated into any Dart or Flutter project, allowing developers to work with various data types effortlessly.

## Features
- **Generic CRUD Operations**: Simplifies the process of creating, reading, updating, and deleting data with any model type.
- **Bloc Pattern Integration**: Utilizes the Bloc pattern for efficient state management, making it easier to manage complex state transitions.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to meet specific project requirements.

## Installation

To use this module in your Dart or Flutter project, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dart_generic:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/Heronilde/dart-generic.git

Then run:
  flutter pub get
Usage
1. Import the Module
  import 'package:dart_generic/dart_generic.dart';

2. Example: Using the Generic Bloc for CRUD Operations

  final bloc = GenericBloc<MyModel>();

// Create an item
bloc.add(CreateItemEvent<MyModel>(item: myModelInstance));

// Listen to state changes
bloc.stream.listen((state) {
  if (state is GenericLoadSuccess<MyModel>) {
    print('Item loaded: ${state.item}');
  }
});

// Update an item
bloc.add(UpdateItemEvent<MyModel>(id: myModelId, item: updatedModel));

// Delete an item
bloc.add(DeleteItemEvent<MyModel>(id: myModelId));

3. Working with Different Models
  You can easily reuse this module for different models by passing the appropriate type parameter:
  final productBloc = GenericBloc<ProductModel>();
  final userBloc = GenericBloc<UserModel>();
